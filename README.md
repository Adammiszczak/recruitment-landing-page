# General info

This landing page is cut from .psd file.

## Local develop

Keep in mind that GH Pages have some issues with path to resources (unless it's made with jekyll") so after you clone this repository, you need to manually change paths.

Better way is just copy local-dev-branch which is holding local state of files

If you want to make some styling, remember to do it at .scss files, then compile the style.scss


## In progress

* The logic behind menu
* Small changes at slider logic
* Some animations and hover effects
